- [x] Allow limiting the entire analysis to a specific season range @Luis
- [ ] Optional: Create toggle button that allows only comparing players to the avg draft picks with the same position @
- [x] Allow the user to set the penalty percentile through a widget @Luis
- [x] Allow the user to set the minimum games (for player rankings and graphs) through a widget @Luis
- [ ] Optional: Create toggle button that allows weighing the team analysis by games/minutes played of their players @
- [ ] Create an aggregated analysis (combine all stats into one) in the team analysis section @
